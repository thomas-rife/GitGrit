# Ideation

## 1. Which audiences did you consider, and which one did you settle on for your app?
Gamers are a group that needs a new way to track and stay involved with their game at all times because they value their performance. 
Crypto investors are a group that needs a convenient way to track all of their investments in one place.
People who exercise are a community who need a way to progress because they value self-improvement. 
We settled on the people who exercise. 
## 2. List the ten needs that you identified for your chosen audience
1. Find a place to work out
2. Track their weightlifting progression
3. Track other types of exercise, such as running
4. Food tracking app
5. Find people to work out with
6. Track the time of their exercise
7. Recovery tracker
8. Nutrition/Food tracker
9. Body weight tracker
10. Calculate when to go to the gym depending on business
## 3. State the three needs that were chosen out of the ten, and state the projects that you mapped to those needs
1. Need to find a place to workout. This maps to a project where we design a web app that has a map of gyms, running routes, etc. We could do things with the users location, which would be interesting. Could use an API that has a map. Also, our users could review the differernt places.
2. Food Tracking App. This maps to a web app where users could enter what food they eat, and it would calculate things like their total calories, protien, carbs, etc. We would use a food API and a database to hold their meals. Also, we could query for foods that would keep them within their goals, therefore giving users reommendations.
3. Weightlifting tracker: This maps to a web app that keeps track of what users have done during their workout. We could use a API that has different exercises that users can use to select exercises. One interesting thing we could do is graph their progression in order to help make our users are improving. Also, we could give recommendations on exercises or weight.
## 4. For each of the three projects, list the goals/ideas that you brainstormed for them
1. Easy way to find a gym. Help users know where the best place to go is. Distancwe to gym. Gyms hours. Could incorporate idea of when the best time to go is.
2. Easy and convienent way to track calories. Suggestions for what to eat. Incentives to hit calorie goals. Alerts when eating to much sugar, for example.
3. Quick way to enter workout. Workouts very repetive, so predict what you are doing next. Give recommendations. Graphs to show progress. Cool animations or something to reward users.
## 5. State the “winner” of this process
The winner of this project is the workout/weightlifting tracker.
