# Pitch

## State the final inspiration statement that you crafted for your chosen audience
Have you ever been exercising and decided that you want to start tracking your progress? After looking through the options of apps they are all very poor, they make you enter the same information again and again, they have glitches and crash, and worst of all they have ads. We wanted to develop an app that adressed these issues and make it as easy and convienent as possible for our users to improve.
## State the possible solutions from preliminary ideation that you considered
- Gym finder: A web app that has a map of gyms, running routes, etc. We could do things with the users location, which would be interesting. Could use an API that has a map. Also, our users could review the differernt places.
- Food Tracking App: A web app where users could enter what food they eat, and it would calculate things like their total calories, protien, carbs, etc. We would use a food API and a database to hold their meals. Also, we could query for foods that would keep them within their goals, therefore giving users reommendations.
- Weightlifting tracker: A web app that keeps track of what users have done during their workout. We could use a API that has different exercises that users can use to select exercises. One interesting thing we could do is graph their progression in order to help make our users are improving. Also, we could give recommendations on exercises or weight.
## State the final app idea that your team has decided to do
Our group decided on the weighlifting tracker, since this category of apps are the ones in the most need of improvement.
